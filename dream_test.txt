Last night I dreamt I was walking on an unfamiliar beach. The sand was warm, and the seawater had an unusual blue-green color. As I strolled, I discovered an ancient wooden box half-buried in the sand. When I crouched down to open it, I suddenly noticed a small boat on the distant water with a blurry figure waving at me.
I hesitated, unsure whether to open the box or pursue the boat. Just then, it began to rain, but the raindrops turned into small flower petals when they touched me. I looked up at the sky and saw that the blue sky had transformed into a starry night, although it was still daytime.
Finally, I decided to abandon the box and walk toward the boat, but with each step I took, the water receded, making it impossible for me to get closer to the boat. I started to feel anxious, and at that moment, a seagull landed on my shoulder with unusually bright eyes, as if trying to tell me something. Then I woke up.
